# Simplified Monopoly Game Modeling using a Relational Database
In this project, I modelled a gameplay of a simplified version of Monopoly using a relational database and SQL queries.
The database schema was designed to store the necessary data about the players, the properties, the actions taken during the game, and the overall progress of the game.

# Files
This is the SQL code file containing the code used to create the database schema and populate it with data, as well as the SQL queries used to extract information about the game and its progress.  

Game description.pdf: This file contains a top level description of the Monopolee Game<br>
Monopolee report.pdf: This is the report file containing a detailed analysis of the database schema, the SQL queries used, and the results obtained from the Monopoly gameplay modeling<br>
Monopolee Tables.sql: This is the SQL code that contains the code to create the database schema<br> 
Monopolee Values.sql: This is the SQL code that contains the code to populate the database schema with data<br>
Dice Roll.sql: This contains SQL Code for retrieving Player location during game play<br>
Initial Procedures.sql: This is the SQL code used to retrieve information required to set conditions for applying the rules of the game<br>
Stored Procedures for applying rules.sql: This contains the SQL code for applying the Monopolee game rules during game play
